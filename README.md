1. On salary day we check Metamask 100 times a day which gives us Anxity and whatnot, if you are in public, your password may also be revealed.
- We solved it by Using **Mailchain**, whenever a Money stream will be** created/deleted** for your account, you will receive a mail about it which will also have a **transaction link** to Mumbai.Polygonscan where you can check more about it.
2. You can create an organization in our app in which you just have to **register employees** once and then our app will use it's data to **create/delete streams**.
- A **unique ID** of the organization is created and assigned to every registered employee, further admin can use this ID to create/delete streams **without needing to specify the Flowrate and receiver's address repeatedly.**
- The admin of the organization can **edit** the Flowrate and Wallet Address of an employee by the pre-assigned ID.
3. X-Streams
- Admin can create **one to many money streams for all Employees of the organization in just one click** through a smart contract.

- There is an **IDs page** in which you can see all the IDs of Employees of your Organization.
- There is a page for displaying **Past Transactions** in which Admin can see his past transactions with it's Transaction link.
